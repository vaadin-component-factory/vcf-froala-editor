# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring
the codebase. This repo is **single-context**: one `CONTEXT.md` and one `docs/adr/` at the
root.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT.md`** at the repo root: the domain glossary.
- **`docs/adr/`**: read the ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in.

If either doesn't exist yet, **proceed silently**. Don't flag its absence; don't suggest
creating it upfront. The `/domain-modeling` skill (reached via `/grill-with-docs` and
`/improve-codebase-architecture`) creates them lazily when terms or decisions actually get
resolved.

## File structure

```
/
├── CONTEXT.md
├── docs/adr/
│   ├── 0001-slug.md
│   └── 0002-slug.md
├── component/
├── demo/
└── e2e/
```

The Maven reactor's three modules are build artefacts, not bounded contexts: they share one
domain language. Should that ever stop being true, the layout to move to is a root
`CONTEXT-MAP.md` pointing at one `CONTEXT.md` per context.

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept (in an issue title, a refactor proposal, a
hypothesis, a test name), use the term as defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Don't drift to synonyms
the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept you need isn't in the glossary yet, that's a signal: either you're inventing
language the project doesn't use (reconsider) or there's a real gap (note it for
`/domain-modeling`).

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently
overriding:

> _Contradicts ADR-0007 (event-sourced orders), but worth reopening because…_
